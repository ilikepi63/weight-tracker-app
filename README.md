# Weight Tracker App

## Getting started

Make sure you have docker installed:

```
docker-compose up -d 
```

for headless docker mounting. 

Once mounted, Swagger docs can be found at:

```
http://localhost:3001/swagger
```

If you would like, you can also access the local db from standard 27017 port, I left this in incase.
